# Main Fuel and LOX Valves

The main pressurant valves consist of the main fuel valve and the main oxidizer valves.  The valves are control the flow of the Fuel and Oxidizer between the propellant tanks and the engine. The main fuel valve will be located on the fuel side of the test stand which carries Isopropyl alcohol. The main oxidizer valve will be located on the oxidizer side of the test stand which carries liquid oxygen.  The design requirements for each valve is that they be actuated remotely and able to work at pressures up to ~1000 psi. The LOX valve must also be able to work at cryogenic temperatures and be LOX compatible.

Several iterations of the main propellant valves have been worked on.
