#Main Fuel Valve

Servo Actuated Ball Valve

## To do:
  
  - [x] Design housing for servo, linkage, and valve
      - [x] Must maintain motor and valve-housing position against torque during action
        
      - [x] Must have sufficient clearance for physical linkage
      - [x] Print V.0 housing and test
     - [x] Make necessary updates for V.1 
        - [x] Print updated housing
        - [x] Post-process housing for assembly
    - [x] Acquire hardware & bits
    - [x] Assemble
- [x] Write Arduino code for pressure test
 - [ ] Acquire battery with sufficient amperage to operate valve
- [ ] Create test plan
        - [ ] determine all needed parts
        - [ ] acquire all needed parts
- [ ] Test valve with water at 1000 psi
