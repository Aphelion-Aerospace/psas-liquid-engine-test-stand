# Main Fuel and LOX Valves

Where Engineering freshman are:
     
- Not able to actuate manual valves with the needed precision
- Have relatively slow reaction times
- Have long lead times
- object to being on fire 

The main fuel and lox valves are being designed and tested to address all of the above requirements.
