# Main Fuel and LOX Valves

Where Engineering freshman are:
     
- Unable to actuate multiple valves with the needed precision
- prone to distraction and have relatively slow reaction times
- Have long lead times to produce
- object to being set on fire 

The main fuel and lox valves are being designed and tested to address all of the above requirements.
