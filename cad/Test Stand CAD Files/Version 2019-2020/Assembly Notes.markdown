# Notes while updating frame cad:

- Need to measure plastic tank spacers - current estimate 0.5"
- Need to determine fittings on fuel & LOX tank - assuming 0.5" NPT, but that's probably wrong
- Found a 3-way splitting manifold on McMaster - https://www.mcmaster.com/manifolds/=c5bb4e29198d49b68d88d23226feceb5k5zrf4qu
	- 1/2" NPT inlet to 3x 1/4" NPT out in 300-series SS
	- if 3/8" outlet is desired, only availabe in Aluminum
- More work required for component layout - pneumatic actuators are large + amount of pipe bending is unknown now.
