    "    - combustion stability\n",
    "    - throttling\n",
    "    - apparent ease of design\n",

    "The Portland State Aerospace Society is in the process of testing its $2.2kN$ ($500 lb_f$) regeneratively cooled bi-propellant rocket motor. One of the critical steps prior to hot firing the motor is the testing and validating of the propellant injector. For this motor, a pintle style injector was selected and an aluminum test article was machined according to the designs provided by the 2015 Capstone team.  \n",

    "The 2015 engine was designed to employ a liquid oxygen (LOX) centered pintle design. In this design, LOX flows through the center of the pintle and is sprayed outward in a radial pattern. The fuel enters a chamber surrounding the base of the pintle and enters the engine through the annular gap between the outer radius of the pintle and the engine. (See Figures 1 & 2) Inside of the combustion chamber, the two propellants impinge upon each other at right angles. This, ideally, results in a cone shaped spray of well mixed fuel and oxidizer. \n",

    "\n",
    "The pintle injector serves two primary purposes in the engine. First, it delivers the fuel and the oxidizer to the combustion chamber at the correct mass flow rate and pressure. Secondly it mixes the propellants and promotes proper combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the mass flow rate through the injector is controlled by the input pressure for the fuel and oxidizer upstream of the injector. Ideally, the injector will have a pressure drop of between 15 and 25 % of the engine's chamber pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    ">This drop isolates chamber-pressure oscilations from the feed system, reducing pressure coupling between the combustion chamber and the feed system which could lead to instabilities or oscillations in the flow that are driven by various in combustion. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "For pintle injectors, this pressure drop can potentially go as low as 5% [1]. Until PSAS has built some heritage with our pintle designs, it is recommended that the 15-25% range be aimed for. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to some of the available research on pintle injectors, the optimum propellant spray angle is $45^\\circ$. [2]   \n",

    "\n",
    "The idea was that each flow path within the injector has multiple changes to flow area between point of measurement and the atmosphere. The early hand calculations in this project attempted to approximated the overall loss coefficient by segregating the internal flow geometry into segments which could examined individually for pressure losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of those pressure losses could then be added together to determine a total pressure drop estimate, $\\Delta P$. This $\\Delta P$ could then be used along with the mass flow rate to estimate a total $K_L$ for the injector. This showed early promise with the V2 injector and gave pressure drops which agreed with CFD models and physical testing. When attempts were made to scale up the injector design to meet the general requirements of an engine capable of reaching 100km, the errors in the estimate quickly diverged from CFD models. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A note of caution, hand calculations and CFD should be employed during the design phase, but any injector which is to be used in an engine needs be specifically tested to determine its loss coefficients and spray angle performance. Small variations in hole sizes, even when within tolerance, can effect the actual performance of an injector. Theoretical models are valuable to steer the design into the right neighborhood, but still require physical testing for validation.\n",
