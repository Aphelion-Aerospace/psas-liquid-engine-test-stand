# Igniter for 2.2 kN Liquid Engine

Calculations have been acquired by inspecting the [2015 Liquid Engine Captsone](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-capstone-2015/blob/master/2kN/analysis/Jupyter_Notebooks/LFRE.ipynb)

Methods have been refined by interpretation of documents in the external_resources/ directory.

## UPDATES FROM 2019 CAPSTONE:

Igniter design documentation and validation can be found in the root folder under [Igniter-Design-Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-test-stand/blob/master/igniter/Igniter-Design-Documentation.pdf)  I would recommend starting with this document.

CAD for igniter arm can be found in the [Igniter Mockup CAD](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-test-stand/tree/master/igniter/Igniter%20Mockup%20CAD) folder.  The main assembly for the mockup is "Main Assembly.sldasm"

Momentum calculations for holding the arm in place can be found in the [calculations folder](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-test-stand/tree/master/igniter/Calcuations).

New Igniter BOM can be found in the PSAS Shared Drive, in the main [LFETS BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SeBntyje6zpfy1jSxysdBP59IyhFcIg6SvVT6w5Bf4Y/edit?usp=sharing) document.
