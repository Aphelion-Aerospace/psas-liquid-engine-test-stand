The fuel enters a chamber surrounding the base of the pintle and is sprayed into the engine through the annular gap between the outer radius of the pintle and the engine. (See Figures 1 & 2) \n",

Times were recorded every quarter gallon and then plotted to determine flow rates.  The collected measurements were graphed in order to obtain the flow rates.

    "## Damaged turbine flow meter\n",
    "\n",
    "When inspected, it was determined that debris had gotten into the flow meter and damaged the turbine. Root cause is believed to be mis-use due to lack of adequate documentation on how to properly use, maintain, and store the flow meter. The turbine flow meter was located just downstream of the globe valve for the tests performed on 1/19 and was removed prior to the the tests performed on 1/26.  \n",
    "- Recommendation for when a new flow meter is purchased, or otherwise obtained; both the flow meter and a summery write up of how to use, calibrate, and maintain the flow meter be bagged and stored in a labeled container. Any team which desires to use the flow meter must first review the instructions and is responsible for following them.\n",

    "The first issue with our orifice plate set up was that we had difficulty locating an orfice plate which could measure the flow rates we require in a 0.5 inch tube. The closest found was from [O'Keefe Controls](http://catalog.okeefecontrols.com/item/precision-metal-orifices-npt-connections/precision-metal-orifices-npt-adapter/h-125-br) with a flow rate of 3.096 gpm of water at 70 psi. This orific was modified based on sizing calculations provided by the manufaturer with the intention to test the orifice across the expected flow ranges expected to determine the correct orifice $C_v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, larger, issue is in where the pressure tranducers were located relative to the orifice. The pressure transducers were placed as close to the orifice plate as the fittings we had on hand would allow, rather than at one of the standard distances called out in various flow measurement references. At the time the orifice meter was constructed it was believed that we could compensate for the placement of the pressure transducers via calibration. \n",

As we did not have a replacement on hand, we proceeded with the tests with the understanding that there would be some water flow and pressure loss through the LOX circuit when testing the Fuel circuit. This valve was replaced prior to the testing performed on 1/26 with a properly functioning globe valve.\n",

Once properly secured our pressure transducer readings became significanly less scattered.
