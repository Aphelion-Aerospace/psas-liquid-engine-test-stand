    "# Feed System Calculations\n",
    "### Pressurant Volume\n",
    "Most of the following discussion follows from Huzel & Huang (1992) Ch 5. guidlines on gas-pressurized propellant feed systems. We need a starting place, particularly some assumptions and/pr constraints regarding:\n",
    "* Operating temperatures of feed-system components\n",
    "* Propellant properties at the expected extrema of operating conditions\n",
    "* Tank ullage volume\n",
    "* Trapped-propellant volumes at the end of expulsion\n",
    "* Operating tank pressures\n",
    "* Test campaign duration and engine test firing time\n",
    "\n",
    "The following analysis will also make the following assumptions:\n",
    "* Ullage pressurization occurs slowly, e.g. the pressurant is initally in thermal equilibrium with the tank walls and propellant bulk\n",
    "* Tests are short enough that no heat transfer occurs between tank walls, pressurant and propellant (probably a bad assumption)\n",
    "* The N2 pressurant is insoluble in the isopropynol fuel\n",
    "* (For now) N2 pressurant is insoluble in LOX oxidizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally these are the key design requirements:\n",
    "* Sufficient pressurant supply to maintain chamber pressure for a single 60 second burn (but at what pressure?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial fill fraction of the propellant tanks will depend of test fire duration, thrust level, and total pressurization time and ambient air temperature among other things. The most conservative estimate is based on the case where an intially full tank (fill fraction is 100%) is completely emptied. If this is the case the pressurant mass required is determined from the equation of state and the isentropic gas equation. Given this ammount of pressurant gas the tank should become empty just as the pressurant supply tank pressure drops to the regulator set point pressure. Some important issues to consider in this analysis are propellant vaporization, and real gass effects."

Another issue it the current thermodynamic state of the prussurant in the case were it is the same as main propellant pressurization gas (as in our design). Obviously near the end of a burn the regulated pressure supplied to the piston will be different than during the intial actuation due to the mostly-isentropic expansion of the pressurant gasses. Any other pressure transient that propagate up to the actuator taps will also affect their response time.\n",
