created a short term to do list and allocated tasks across group
this list will be moved to Github

Tickets:
Problem Statement
Acceptance criteria
minimize "ANDS" --> Two separate tasks

-We are adding component specific details on our PID
-Erin is mathematically assessing pressurant volumes and pressure requirements based on a simplified system model
-I am working with Bob Watzlavick on details with our LOX and ethanol vents
-


Kyle:
Add annotations to the google doc with reference to the PID regarding warnings and command lock
Work with Matthew Hauer on putting the to-do list on the Github tickets
started ==> Talk to Bob Watzlavick and determine 
	an appropriate LOX Vent and Ethanol Vent through a group hangout (schedule it)
	metering flow (for next build)
	- or - measuring flow (for next build)

Erin:
Will create a Jupiter Notebook and provide us access and details
Creating a number of theoretical scenarios to determine what the volume requirements of the pressurant will be
Required pressurant volume, pressure and Cv across the N2 manifold

Asa:
assign existing part numbers to the PID (work with Asa)
create a key on the SMC PID 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Buy another N2 tank based on volumetric requirements from Erin
	the current tank is located in the rocket room --> spec this tank and get another similar tank

Calculate expected volumetric flow rate for N2 into LOX and Ethanol

Spec parts for N2 tank - Stand Interface
	Hose Type to N2 Manifold
	Fittings for pressurant tank
	
Look into making fill AND VENT lines 3/8 inch to accelerate filling

Calculate necessary volumetric flow rate and pressure for purge valves and spec appropriately

design and spec interface between go valves and engine (hoses and fittings)

Low priority at the moment: Look into flow control valve to meter the flow

Find and acquire LOX tank and piping insulation
