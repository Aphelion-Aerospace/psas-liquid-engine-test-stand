# Igniter for 2.2 kN Liquid Engine

Calculations have been acquired by inspecting the [2015 Liquid Engine Captsone](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-capstone-2015/blob/master/2kN/analysis/Jupyter_Notebooks/LFRE.ipynb)

Methods have been refined by interpretation of documents in the external_resources/ directory.

## UPDATES FROM 2019 CAPSTONE:

Igniter design documentation and validation can be found [here](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-test-stand/igniter/Igniter Design Documentation.pdf).  I would reccomend starting with this document.

CAD for igniter arm can be found in the [Igniter Mockup CAD](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-test-stand/igniter/Igniter Mockup CAD/) folder.

Momentum calculations for holding the arm in place can be found in the calculations folder, [here](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-test-stand/igniter/calculations/).

New Igniter BOM can be found in the PSAS Shared Drive, in the main LFETS BOM document.
