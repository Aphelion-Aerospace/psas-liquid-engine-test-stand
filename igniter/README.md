# Igniter for 2.2 kN Liquid Engine

Calculations have been acquired by inspecting the [2015 Liquid Engine Captsone](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-capstone-2015/blob/master/2kN/analysis/Jupyter_Notebooks/LFRE.ipynb)

Methods have been refined by interpretation of documents in the external_resources/ directory.

## UPDATES FROM 2019 CAPSTONE:

Igniter design documentation and validation can be found in the root folder under "Igniter-Design-Documentation.pdf"  I would recommend starting with this document.

CAD for igniter arm can be found in the "Igniter Mockup CAD" folder.  The main assembly for the mockup is "Main Assembly.sldasm"

Momentum calculations for holding the arm in place can be found in the calculations folder.

New Igniter BOM can be found in the PSAS Shared Drive, in the main LFETS BOM document.

I can't figure out how to make working links... so this will have to do.
