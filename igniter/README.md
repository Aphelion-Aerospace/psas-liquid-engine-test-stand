# Igniter for 2.2 kN Liquid Engine

Calculations have been acquired by inspecting the [2015 Liquid Engine Captsone](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-capstone-2015/blob/master/2kN/analysis/Jupyter_Notebooks/LFRE.ipynb)

Methods have been refined by interpretation of documents in the external_resources/ directory.

This repo contains research into small Augmented Spark Igniters (such as the ones built by [Robert Watzlavick](http://watzlavick.com/robert/rocket/igniters/index.html) and David Gregory of [Rocket Moonlighting](http://www.rocketmoonlighting.com/projects/pr56-igniter)), which may serve as an inspiration for our own design.
